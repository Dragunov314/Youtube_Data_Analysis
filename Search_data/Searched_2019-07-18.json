Today we are making a Black Garlic Pickle Sandwich!!  We get asked many times a week \\\"What do I do with Black Garlic\\\" so we dedicated a handful of videos to show you just how crazy you can get with Riorand's awesome Black Garlic.  In this video we will be lacofermenting some cucumbers with black garlic added to the mix to really boost their flavor.  Looking back at this project I would do a few things differently.  I used a bunch of different varieties of cucumbers and a bunch of different sizes.  For the next batch I think I would try to find \\\"National\\\" or \\\"Regal\\\" varieties.  I would even try to keep them all the same size.  I noticed as the smaller \\\"English seedless\\\" cucumbers fermented and stayed in the brine they were beginning to take on the \\\"black garlic color and the larger cucumbers remained green.  Here is how we lactofermented these cucumbers\\n\\nRecipe:\\n1 Gallon size pickle jar with lid and a hole dripped into it\\n1 air lock\\n2 quarts of brine water (6 tablespoons dissolved in 8 cups of water)\\n6 Riorand Black Garlic cloves chopped into large chunks\\n2 Tablespoons of Pepper corn\\n1 tablespoon of dill seed\\nfresh dill (400 grams)\\n6 bay leaves (you can use grape leaves, black tea, or oak leaves.  This ingredient is to make the pickles crispy)\\nCucumbers for pickling\\n\\nSanitize your equipment and station with Iodophor.  Make bring solution and let cool.  Gently clean your cucumbers and cut off the blossom end.  In your fermenting vessel start to add your black garlic dill, bay leaves, peppercorn, and pickles will everything is jammed packed tight inside your container.  Fill with the cooled brine solution and leave about 2 inches of head space from the top.  Cover with air lock and let it sit in a cool room preferable 75 or below (I like 65F) for 3 weeks.  After 10 days you can pull one out to taste.  As soon as you like the tanginess, crispiness, saltiness, and flavor you can place them in your fridge and eat away!!   The longer you leave your pickles in the Black Garlic brine the more they will start to change in color.  I found 3 weeks perfect for larger pickles and 2 weeks for the smaller ones.  It's a personal preference.\\n\\nHere are a few items that we used in this recipe:\\nRiorand Black Garlic:  https://amzn.to/2XSpWV9\\nAir Lock and gallon container:  https://amzn.to/2XWvTvf\\nIodophor sanitizer:  https://amzn.to/2SofXB5\\n\\nWe invite you to check out our new Amazon storefront.
