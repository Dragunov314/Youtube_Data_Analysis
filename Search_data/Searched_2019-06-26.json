You should seek a vein specialist who uses a state-of-the-art, full-size vascular ultrasound machine.\\n\\nCERTIFIED SONOGRAPHER\\nYour vein specialist should employ a dedicated, full-time certified vascular sonographer who has extensive experience evaluating venous insufficiency. Many vein practices merely pay a sonographer as needed for a day or half a day each week. These sonographers are not part of the physician\\u2019s practice.
