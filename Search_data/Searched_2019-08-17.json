This was made as a request by many of you down in the comments of the previous video and on my twitter :) \\n\\nResin Obsession sent me a couple 3oz samples of their resin material for making these dice, and I can thoroughly say that their resin is fantastic. The quality and ease of use is spectacular, and I have had 0 problems with their resin throughout this whole process. It is a bit more expensive than my normal go-to resin, but if  you are really looking for some quality stuff, you cannot go wrong with Resin Obsession's stuff. \\n\\nThis is essentially the same process as my other dice. Glue a sprue onto the mold, glue the mold down, mix the silicone, degass it, pour it on the dice. Then take the dice out after a day, pour in the resin, put it in a pressure pot and blamo, you got a nice new set of transparent dice for d&d. Or if not dnd, then any other ttrpg game of your choice.\\n\\nI used food dye in this video, which is water based. Be careful how much of that stuff you use, as too much will ruin your dice.

It's on sale often, I got it for 20 bucks on sale. https://amzn.to/2zccY5P\\n\\nI also used dixie cups, pop-sickle sticks, blue food coloring, pipettes, and various pigments from Hobby Lobby or Michaels. You can find plenty of different pigment styles for various prices online or in stores. I also used just plain food dye and you can see, it came out great as well.
